Although the overwhelming majority of video games are a form of animation it's okay to forgo this genre when adding them as this is implied by the title type. Objective."
Comedy,"Virtually all scenes should contain characters participating in humorous or comedic experiences. The comedy can be exclusively for the viewer, at the expense of the characters in the title, or be shared with them. Please submit qualifying keywords to better describe the humor (i.e. spoof, parody, irony, slapstick, satire, dark-comedy, comedic-scene, etc.). If the title does not conform to the 'virtually all scenes' guideline then please do not add the comedy genre; instead, submit the same keyword variations described above to signify the comedic elements of the title.
